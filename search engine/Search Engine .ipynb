good job you can do the rest agnes good job hi do you need any more help no we ll manage everything will be fine hi good job we sent two patient to voss today and six to haukeland we ve treated eight patient here what would have happened without the emergency department with jenny pernille s daughter she wouldn t have lived without the right competence jenny wouldn t have lived so maybe you should make sure you have that competence here do you want your job back no but every one of your employee showed their competence tonight and that must be nurtured constantly every goddamn building block is important here if you remove the ed the hospital fall apart i wish it were that simple but one isolated extraordinary occurrence like this can t dictate our future come on henry when did you start caring about this he said his name wa ludvig he came in the autumn rain and knocked on the door he wa looking for shelter it wa impossible to stay outside i examined the figure closer where on earth did this stranger come from ludvig wiped his nose and pointed disorientedly into the pitch black night he had taken a left turn under a rotten rail fence at prestenget if he could stay under the eaves away from the wind he would be fine under the eaves no the stranger would have to come inside he wa soaking wet thanks to the great coordination with haukeland and voss we didn t lose a single life in this tragic accident many people in odda are worried that the closure of the ed is just the first step on the way to closing the entire hospital if you ignore the emotion and look at the fact odda hospital is an indefensible expense there are too few people in the municipality but i think we should talk about today s event instead of we should be damn happy that the accident happened today our proximity to the accident site and the competence at the hospital were crucial if the politician don t wake up soon this hospital will crumble and then we ll get more death that could have been avoided so how much are these life worth like i said this wa an extraordinary occurrence and our vision is still and must be a unified good morning good morning cool t shirt hi isn t that a little melodramatic building your own coffin it s not for me it s for ola he s not in it right no jenny wa dead and you talked to her the way you ve talked to ola nilsen you re sure they re not hallucination i don t know i did talk to her she wa standing there yeah we should give ola nilsen a proper funeral yeah that s the idea can i help you with anything yes you can hammer in the final nail in the coffin no okay here you can sand it sand down the corner do we have everything we ve packed everything i guess we re ready we re ready this is so nice it s nice ali alicante cante cante ali right let s go let s see oh my hello henry hi hi there you are we don t lock our door in odda for a reason hi hi how are you well for a dying man i m doing all right it s time for your injection i can do it before i go to work that polio stuff yeah it s one in a million there s no point maybe a brilliant doctor is about to invent the cure for cancer a danish one living in odda let s hope so come on you know it could be fatal yeah it s a good thing i m a doctor okay still alive did you hear they won t close down the hospital what we won the first round anyway there thank you don t touch how s your head it s fine hello i m on my way any major injury hi hi any mail for me before i leave no nothing but smestad asked for you he s here and would like to see you right but the most important thing is that i m having a garden party tonight we re celebrating the survival of the ed you know what i think of party yes i do but if there s one party you should go to it s this one don t be so boring what can i say i m great at party hi hi where are you headed i m going home yeah and you re okay yeah lovely what about ola nilsen any luck with the virus sample i gave you did they make him better i think he s given up given up that s a shame there s a study from a test group in the u that show that in of the case the tumour is stable after polio treatment they survived yeah for month on average some of them live for five year so if you talk to ola you should mention it to him right thank you thomas thank you you re welcome okay hi what s up un fuckin believable you have a lovely home finally thank you everyone s here okay i can t believe you finally came this is for you that wasn t necessary thank you have fun hi hi can you see what it say no the ed lyfe lyfe with a y why because susanne

trying to to help ace well you know he s been doing a lotta audition and stuff like that hmm i think blaze is gonna be a little actor though oh for sure i wa thinking about finding her a little dance class you know yeah i think that would be good the other thing that i am trying to work on for some month now me and todd we ve been trying to work on this estate planning oh okay and we decided we re gonna do different trust for the stuff that you had before the marriage that should be on a separate trust for your child still you have to give somethin to your husband well really your husband would would have accumulated enough from what you all have had together but i think with riley being the child that wa there before anybody i think that s the child that you should put in the forefront what about ace and blaze i m sayin they have a father riley have never benefited from having a father i feel like my father never really did anything cause you had the capability to be there even when it come to my trust i feel like my husband should get something when you are gone why you gonna set somebody up with a lavish lifestyle where and then somebody move into your house oh you mean like another uh uh uh uh that s what i mean that s what i mean that ain t happening if tragedy were to strike i would prefer that he stayed single he could be in a relationship but never marry meaning that person never ha any legal right to anything that could possibly go to my kid but you can have a mate and have fun but they will never get nothin who will be in charge of the trust the joint trust we talked about donjuan i think donjuan plus somebody else okay like donjuan and me you re killing me off early i see laughing no well what i m saying no i uh no if something happened and my mom and todd had to figure thing out together it would be tough are you and todd gonna be able to get along is the question laughing well we would have to would you be nice laughing hello don t you look amazing

to take back the neko ninja crew wait you have spy usagi we re ninja we re basically all spy yeah that make sense chizu you need help thanks but i think i have to handle this myself man ninja really know how to make an exit huh don t look don t look i can see through your hand a little then close your eye okay open them huh behold the defensebotto wow it s a miracle of engineering unfortunately it s hard for me to control it because of my ghostly hand gen i would like you to operate it because of my fighting skill because you have the thickest skin it might explode hmm pas gen if the invasion come we ll need everything we can get all right okay fine yes up you go uh yeah i don t like height just think of it a deep but upside down don t tap the glass i thought your people were frozen they are but fingerprint so look what i got ahh oh no sorry i forgot the last time you saw willow branch uh yes it is not a good memory let u hope it can cut the clavis free perhaps it can save your people though it seems to be too late to save mine oh well if i chop off the clavis and stop the gateway from opening you ll never find out how to return them to normal no but usagi you must do what is necessary to protect your own people try not to mess up the ki stone usagi i m proud of you let s do this ikuzo you totally missed man he didn t miss why did you pull back if i do this kagehito s people will never get out of that bubble usagi if the clavis open that gateway it could be the literal end of the world you have to chop that thing off right now it just doesn t feel right to win if others suffer there ha to be a better way you may have a point and if we stop this gateway sooner or later the makkine will just create another so what are we supposed to do the only way to keep this world safe is to defeat the makkine to hit them so hard they ll never attack u again to scare them off forever and we can t do that unless we let them come through that gateway are you nut did you see the claw that came through before usagi s right this is the only way ugh i really don t like it but you re right we can t run from this fight yeah guess we ll just have to find a way to defeat them fuwa could be here at any moment you and you crossbow in the alley uh you two guard the secret entrance fumiko and i will stay here the rest of you defensive maneuver six every day we lose more ninja to fuwa and her so called true crew ninja but you ninja who remain are the best one yeah woo hoo yes we are okay now that the spy ha gone to tell fuwa our plan here s the real plan watch

all right she seems to be fine whatever kiyoko is she must be nearly indestructible indestructible tetsujin that botto is impossible no no dividing by zero is impossible the defensebotto is merely difficult can you find someone else i ll do it oh and he wa doing so well for the first one and a half second that thing is defective it is impossible to control i know right it s like the world s most complicated puppet kitsune what the only one who could possibly control the defensebotto would be a puppeteer so you re telling me my skill with puppet could be the thing that save the world weirdly enough yeah i always knew this day would come i keep saying someday puppetry will save the world but everyone keep saying why are you yelling at me this is a library okay let s do this come on kiyoko you can t get stepped on if you re up there with me yes best friend don t press the button with the smiling face this one that s the one i probably should ve put a lightning bolt on that button
